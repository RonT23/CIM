# Hot Rolling Fuzzy Package

This package provides a custom fuzzy logic system utility based for the hot rolling process control as described in *"Fuzzy control algorithm for the prediction of tension variations in hot rolling"* - Jong-Yeob Jung, Yong-Taek Im. 

The system is designed to receive as input the entry thickness ($h_{in}$ in mm) and the carbon equivalent ($C\%$x$10^{-3}$) of the material and produce the variations required in back and front tensions ($\Delta\sigma_b$, $\Delta\sigma_f$ in percentage) required in order to obtain a hot rolled product of high accuracy in thickness uniformity.
